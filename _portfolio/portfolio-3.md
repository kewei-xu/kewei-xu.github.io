title: "Super-Resolution for Downscaling on Oceanographic Fields"
thumbnail: "proj_superres.png"
excerpt: " I frame the downscaling of oceanographic fields as a super-resolution task and address it with a deep learning approach. Building on the classical [SRCNN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092). I optimize both the network architecture and the data pipeline, and achieve satisfactory results on the [NATL60](https://catalog.pangeo.io/browse/master/ocean/MEOM_NEMO) dataset."
